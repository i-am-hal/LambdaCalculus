#A function that acts like a truth machine
# (for this to run, you'll need to load the builtins.txt
# file so we can use some functions)

#In debug mode (when on) it will show this function call and
# it will slowly acrew an infinite sea of a particular value
let repeat = (\val. (\x.x x val) (\x.x x val));

#(Only really works when debug mode is on)
#When the function is given 0, it returns 0,
# otherwise it gives back a sea of 1s
let truth = (\n.(zero? n) 0 (\.repeat 1));
